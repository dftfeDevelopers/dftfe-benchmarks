Description of the example
==========================
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation, ionic relaxation, cell relaxation on Lithium Lanthanum Zirconate unit-cell employing periodic boundary conditions in all directions. ONCV pseudopotentials from SG15 database, PBE exchange correlation and Fermi-Dirac smearing temperature of 500 K are used. 

Studies to be performed
=======================
* Ground-state calculation: Spin-unpolarized calculation with convergence study of ground-state energy, ionic forces and cell stresses with respect to FE discretization to reach chemical accuracy (see examples 1 and 2). Validation with Quantum espresso refined calculation.
* Ground-state calculation: Spin-polarized ground-state calculation using mesh parameters obtained in the above study and validate the ground-state energy, forces and stresses with Quantum espresso.
* Ionic relexation and cell relaxation for both spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized calculation and validation with Quantum espresso.
