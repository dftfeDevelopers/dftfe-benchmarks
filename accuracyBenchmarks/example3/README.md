Description of the example
--------------------------
This example demonstrates an all-electron ground-state calculation with non-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on Benzamide. GGA exchange correlation and Fermi-Dirac smearing temperatrure of 500 K are used.

Studies to be performed
------------------------
* Ground-state calculation: convergence study of ground-state energy and ionic forces with respect to discretization, and validation against NWChem. 

* Ionic relaxation and validation against NWChem.


Discussion on the input parameters and the results
