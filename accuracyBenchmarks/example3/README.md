Description of the example
==========================
This example demonstrates an all-electron ground-state calculation with non-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on Benzamide. PBE exchange correlation and Fermi-Dirac smearing temperatrure of 500 K are used.

Studies to be performed
=======================
* 1) Ground-state calculation: convergence study of ground-state energy and ionic forces with respect to discretization, and validation against NWChem. 
* 2) Ionic relaxation and validation against NWChem.
