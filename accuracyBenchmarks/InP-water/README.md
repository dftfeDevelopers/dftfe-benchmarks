Description of the example
==========================
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with semi-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on water molecule over InP slab. Multiple k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone along the periodic directions, ONCV pseudopotential from PseudoDojo database, PBE exchange correlation, and Fermi-Dirac smearing temperature of 500 K are used. Periodic boundary conditions along X and Y directions and non-periodic boundary conditions along Z direction with a vaccum layer are employed.

Studies to be performed
=======================
* 1) Ground-state calculation: convergence study of ground-state energy and ionic forces to reach chemical accuracy (see examples 1 and 2) with respect to FE discretization and k-points, and validation against QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE).
* 2) Ionic relaxation and validation against QE.
