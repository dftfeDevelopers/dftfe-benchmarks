Description of the example
--------------------------
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with fully periodic boundary conditions on BCC Mo supercell with a mono-vacancy. Norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA exchange correlation is used.

Studies to be performed
------------------------
* Ground-state calculation


Discussion on the input parameters and the results
-------------------------------------------

* Energy per atom comparison with QE reference: 1.7e-4 Ha/atom
* Ionic forces comparison with QE reference: 2.5e-4 Ha/Bohr (max absolute error among all atoms and force components)
