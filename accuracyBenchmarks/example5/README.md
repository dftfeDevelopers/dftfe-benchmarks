Description of the example
==========================
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with semi-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on InP-water layer. Multiple k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone along the periodic directions, norm-conserving pseudopotential and PBE exchange correlation are used.

Studies to be performed
=======================
* 1) Ground-state calculation: convergence study of ground-state energy and ionic forces with respect to FE discretization, and validation against QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE).
* 2) Ionic and validation against QE.
