* **example1**
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with fully periodic boundary conditions on BCC Mo supercell with a mono-vacancy. Norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA exchange correlation are used.

* **example2**
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with non-periodic boundary conditions on Al nanoparticle. Norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA exchange correlation are used.

* **example3**
This example demonstrates an all-electron ground-state calculation with non-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on Benzamide. Norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA exchange correlation are used.

* **example4**
This example demonstrates an all-electron ground-state calculation with fully periodic boundary conditions and cell relaxation on GaAs unit cell. Multiple k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone, norm-conserving pseudopotential, and GGA exchange correlation are used.

* **example5**
This example demonstrates an all-electron ground-state calculation with fully periodic boundary conditions and combined ionic-cell relaxation on Al12Mg17 intermetallic. Multiple k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone, norm-conserving pseudopotential, and GGA exchange correlation are used.

* **example6**
This example demonstrates a ground-state calculation with semi-periodic boundary conditions and ionic relaxation on InP-water layer. Multiple k-points for sampling the Brillouin zone along the periodic directions, norm-conserving pseudopotential and GGA exchange correlation are used.
