This repository contains two primary types of benchmarks for
the [DFT-FE code](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/dftfe), and is maintained by the DFT-FE developers.

### Accuracy benchmarks ###
The **accuracyBenchmarks** directory contains examples involving small system sizes, which are designed to cover most of the capabilities of the DFT-FE code. Dependening on the type of example, they are also validated against another open-source code (if available). 

### Performance benchmarks ###
The **performanceBenchmarks** directory contains medium and large-scale performance benchmarks for DFT-FE on both CPUs and GPUs.
