This repository has two primary types of benchmarks for
the DFT-FE code

### Accuracy benchmarks/Examples ###
The **accuracyBenchmarks** directory contains examples involving small system sizes, which are designed to cover most of the capabilities of the DFT-FE code. Dependening on the type of example, they are also validated against another open-source code (if available). 

### Performance benchmarks ###
The **performanceBenchmarks** directory contains medium and large-scale performance benchmarks of DFT-FE on both CPUs and GPUs.
